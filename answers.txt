Problem 1: Parse Tree and Leftmost Derivation
Using the grammar below, show a parse tree and a leftmost derivation for the following
statement:
A = B * (C * (A + B))
Grammar:
Statement → Assignment | Expression
Assignment → Identifier = Expression
Expression → Expression + Term | Term
Term → Term * Factor | Factor
Factor → ( Expression ) | Identifier
Identifier → A | B | C
  
Leftmost derivation
 Statement
 Assignment
 Identifier = Expression
 A = Expression
 A = Term
 A = Term * Factor
 A = Factor * Factor
 A = B * Factor
 A = B * ( Expression )
 A = B * ( Term )
 A = B * ( Term * Factor )
 A = B * ( Factor * Factor )
 A = B * ( C * Factor )
 A = B * ( C * ( Expression ) )
 A = B * ( C * ( Expression + Term ) )
 A = B * ( C * ( Term + Term ) )
 A = B * ( C * ( Factor + Term ) )
 A = B * ( C * ( A + Term ) )
 A = B * ( C * ( A + Factor ) )
 A = B * ( C * ( A + B ) )

 

Problem 2: Scope Concepts
Considering the following program written in pseudocode:
int u = 42;
int v = 69;
int w = 17;
proc add( z:int )
u := v + u + z;
proc bar( fun:proc )
int u := w;
fun(v);
proc foo( x:int, w:int )
int v := x;
bar(add);
main
foo(u, 13);
print(u);
end;
a. Using Static Scope, what is printed to the screen?
Answer: 180
Basic static scope which prints out the global u in print(u) which would be 42(u)+69(v)+69(v)=180.

b. Using Dynamic Scope with Deep Binding, what is printed to the screen?
Hint: The sum for u is 126, but due to deep binding, it's foo's local v that gets involved.
Answer: 126
With Deep binding we bind at the time the function is passed as an argument. So global u from the print(u) which is 42(u)+42(u)+42(u)= 126.

c. Using Dynamic Scope with Shallow Binding, what is printed to the screen?
Hint: The sum for u is 101, but again it's foo's local v that matters.
Answer: 97
With Shallow Binding print(u) prints the local u from the "bar(add) which would be 13(foo)+42(u)+42(u) = 97
